# IUPUI's Computer Science Club Presents: Webmasters Hackathon!
IUPUI's Computer Science Club is hosting a hackathon for students to practice and apply their programming skills. This event, titled "Webmasters", will focus on Web Development.

Please read through the rest of this document carefully - it will hopefully answer any questions you may have about the event. It will also help you to avoid any issues later. You can always ask questions if you have any.

**Who Can Participate?**

This event is open to everyone! This includes (but is not limited to) Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors, Graduate students from any school at IUPUI. 

## The Theme: Webmasters
For this hackathon, you are tasked with creating a website. Create a website using any web stack and and web framework that you would like, from **Node.js** to **Django** to a **PythonAnywhere** website! From there, the rest is up to you! What kind of website do you want to create? Some ideas/technologies include:

* databases
* web games
* e-commerce site
* blog site
* event website
* APIs

These are just a few ideas to help get you motivated, so if there's something else you want to make, then go for it! This is your chance to put your skills to the test or learn some new ones. 

## Prizes
This event will give out prizes for projects that show a great level of thought and work was put in.

### Grand Prizes
This event will have prizes for the top-performing students at each grade level from Freshman to Graduate Students, and for Groups. Each grade will get a 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place prize. Groups will be their own level, with all groups competing with each other. The grand prizes are as follows:

#### 1st Place:
The first place student in at each level will receive:

The first place group will receive:

#### 2nd Place:
The second place student at each level will receive: 

The second place group will receive:

#### 3rd Place:
The third place student at each level will receive: 

The third place group will receive:

On top of this, we will have prizes for:

### Category Prizes
This event will also give out prizes to projects that didn't place in any of the grand prize categories but still showed outstanding performance in one of the following categories:

#### Outstanding Project Workflow
Doing a project takes more than just the technical skills. Projects must be carefully planned out with the available scope, cost, and time in mind. Did you take into account what skills you had at hand when you started your project? What plan did you make in order to meet the requirements you set for yourself (or your group) and know that you are on track?

#### Outstanding User Experience
How much thought did you put into your user's experience? While the first task is to get your project to work, at the end of the day someone has to use it. When that time comes, how will your project hold?

#### Outstanding Back End
Any programmer will know that the more features you have, the trickier it can be to organize and code the back end of your website. How did you organize your project so that coding your features in the back end would go as smoothly as possible? Did you do any diagrams to understand the data you are using and find ways to organize it?

## Rules
The rules for this event aren't a lot, but please stick to them:

**NO School-Inappropriate Content**
Please refrain from creating anything that would be considered inappropriate for an educational/school setting. Inappropriate submissions will be immediately disqualified from the event and reported to the school.
*If you have any concerns about your project, please speak with a club officer. 

**NO Plagiarism**
This is your chance to learn something new and apply it, not rip off someone else's work. While it is acceptable to learn how to do something when you don't already know, copying and pasting code or copying entire projects is not what this event is about. This also means that you are to refrain from simply taking a previous project  and submitting it or modifying it for this event. We want to see what you can do in the time given.

## Scoring
The event will be scored on the following categories:

1. **Documentation:**
Documentation is crucial for the success of any project. This is a good chance to practice keeping track of what was done in your project and how you went from zero to website.

> How good is your planning and final documentation? 
> Did you clearly state what it is you are trying to accomplish? 
> Did you set up a reasonable schedule with clearly-marked milestones? Did you explain how to use the program?

2. **Creativity:** 
This event was made open ended so that you can take this in any direction you wish. Get creative with it- where do your passions lie?

> What clever thing did you do with your web site? 
> What problem did you solve, or what fun tool did you make? 
> How much of your personality shines through the project?

4. **Coding Style:**
Documentation is only one part - your code has to be readable and sensible so that you and others can quickly understand how it works.

> Did you use a strong coding style? 
> Did you comment well? 
> Did you use sensible variable and function names? 
> Did you use accepted programming practices?

6. **Complexity:**
While we have a limited amount of time to compete, we want to see what you can do. 
*If you are a novice to web development, don't worry - the goal of this event is to learn something new and apply it in a useful way. Just do your best.

> Did you try to tackle a very simple problem with few parameters? 
> Or did you add a substantial amount of features to make the program more flexible and usable?
>  If you used a language without a lot of built-in features, how did you get it to work?

8. **Professionalism:**
We want to see not only what you can do, but how refined you can make your project.

> Does the program work well without flaws and hiccups? 
> Is it easy for users to learn and use?

10. **Aesthetics:**
There are lots of options to make a website look/feel good. While the priority of any computer scientist is functionality, UX (User Experience) doesn't simply disappear.

> Did you think carefully about what tools will best allow the best User Experience?

12. **Presentation (Video Submission):**
Once you have a complete project, the work is not quite done. Having the capability to explain your work to other is not just useful - it is *essential* to working in the industry. Do your best to walk us through your website in video format with all of its use cases. You will submit your code, but due to the nature of this hackathon and the possible we frameworks out there - there are hundreds - unless you make the website available on the internet we may not be able to experience your website first-hand. This is your chance to make sure everything is 100% clear to the graders.

*While I don't want to give an exact time limit on video submissions, please keep the time reasonable. Just enough time to get your point across for your website's features and anything else worth mentioning. While it is a good trait to be able to speak about your project, rambling on and on is not. To put it in a few words: **Clear and to the point is key.**

> Did you have a solid presentation that confidently shows the features of your program? 
> Did you explain it well? Did you present well?

## Examples for Beginners
Below are some examples on how to get started with programming a website. Feel free to watch/ look at the code to get ideas and understand the basics of web development.

*You are not required to use any of the examples given here or the web stacks used. If you already have web development experience and want to use what you know, then perfect.

## Submission Details
For this event, we will be having you submit your project using a combination of canvas and github. When you are finished with your project, you will be asked to upload your code and documentation to github, then provide your name (or group name), your project's name, the video presentation, and the link to your github repository on canvas.

*Submissions will NOT be accepted past the deadline. Everyone has the same amount of time to work on their projects. Please ask if you have any questions. If you wish to submit after the deadline anyway, you can, but you will not be eligible for prizes.

## Other Details
By submitting a project in this event, you are agreeing to allowing us to show your project in future events and to promote the club as well as archiving the submission for club records. The project stays as your own - this is NOT a claim to creating it or call it ours. If we decide to use your project in any media or at any events, you will be credited and cited. Let us know if you have any questions about this.
